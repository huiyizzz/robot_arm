This is a robot arm.

There are 3 sliders on the top, which could change the rotations.
Once click the canvas, it will activate the inverse kinematics. The rotation of robot base will be zero, and there will be a red ball showing up and the robot arm tip will reach the ball smoothly.
If the position of the clicking the robot cannot reach, there will be no red ball in canvas and the robot will be keep its previous position.
Every time, the first clicking after moving sliders will let the robot arm moves from initial position.If this clicking is unreachable, the arm will be stay at the initial position.
